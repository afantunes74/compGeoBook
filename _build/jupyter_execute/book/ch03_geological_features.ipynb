    "The fundamental geometric features of geology are lines (e.g. a lineation, a fold axis) and planes (e.g. bedding, a foliation). A *line* is the element generated by a moving point. It can be straight or curved. We will treat straight lines here. A *plane* is a flat surface; a line joining two points on the plane lies wholly on its surface, and two intersecting lines on the plane define the plane. This is equivalent to say that three non-collinear points on the plane define the plane (this is the basis for the well-known three-points problem). Obviously, linear features can be curved (e.g. the intersection of bedding with irregular topography), and surfaces can be non-planar (e.g. bedding in a fold). However, even these more complex cases can be expressed as a collection of lines and planes."

    "\n",
    "A plane orientation can be defined by the angle a horizontal line on the plane makes with the geographic north, known as the *strike*, and the maximum angle measured downward from the horizontal to the plane, known as the *dip* ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig01>`a). The strike is measured as an azimuth, an angle between 0 and 360 (0 = north, 90 = east, 180 = south, 270 = west). The dip is an angle between 0 (horizontal plane) and 90(vertical plane). The projection of the dip onto the horizontal is known as the *dip direction* and is always 90from the strike. However, is the dip direction plus or minus 90the given strike? Which end of the strike line should we use? To avoid ambiguities, we will use a format known as the *right hand rule* (RHR). In the RHR format, one gives the strike such that the dip direction is always the strike plus 90, i.e. the dip direction is to the right of the strike ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig01>`a)."

You can verify that it works by setting $\\beta$ = 0 (a cross section parallel to strike) which gives $\\alpha$ = 0 (since $\\sin(0)$ is 0), and $\\beta$ = 90( a cross section perpendicular to strike) which gives $\\alpha$ = $\\delta$ (since $\\sin (90)$ is 1). This leads to an important observation: *A dipping plane shows horizontal in a cross section parallel to strike, and the true dip of the plane can only be observed in a cross section perpendicular to strike*.

The plunge has a range between -90 and 90. Positive plunge indicates lines pointing downwards, and negative plunge lines pointing upwards. To measure the trend and plunge one must determine the vertical plane containing the line. This is quite difficult and often results in errors ([Section 3.2.5](ch03-2-5)). For this reason, and if the line is on a plane, it is more accurate (and convenient) to measure the angle on the plane between the strike line and the line. This angle is known as the rake or pitch ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig02>`b). To avoid any confusion, the rake should be always measured from the given strike and thus it varies between 0 and 180."

    "### Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "All maps are a projection of surface or subsurface geological features onto a horizontal plane. In [Section 2.3](ch02-3), we looked at the different methods used to project data from the approximately spherical Earth to a flat surface, and the distortions associated to these methods. Geological features (bedding, faults, the ground surface) are rarely flat, and therefore to display the spatial variation of their elevation (or depth) on maps, we use contours. A contour line is a line joining the points in the map area of equal value for a specific parameter. On a topographic map, for example, contour lines join points of equal elevation on the ground surface. Contour lines should not cross (unless very unusual circumstances) or disappear in the middle of the map (unless the contoured feature is intersected by another feature). If the difference in value between adjacent contours or contour interval is held constant throughout the map, the gradient (rate of change) of the parameter in a given direction is proportional to the spacing of the contour lines: high gradient is represented by closely spaced contours, and low gradient by widely spaced contours. This is expressed by the following relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textit{gradient} = \\arctan\\left( \\frac{\\textit{parameter_change_between_contours}}{\\textit{map_distance_between_contours}} \\right)\n",
    "$$ (ch03_eq05)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a topographic map, this relation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textit{slope_angle} = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{\\textit{elevation_change_between_contours}}{\\textit{map_distance_between_contours}} \\right)\n",
    "$$ (ch03_eq06)\n",
    "\n",
    "which is why when choosing the path to a high ground area, you should look for the widely spaced contours (unless you are a climber or a goat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Geological features are rarely isolated, and they usually have different orientations, so we should expect them to intersect. The intersection of two non-parallel planes (e.g. bedding contacts) is a straight line. In [Chapter 4](ch04), we will see how to determine this type of intersection using vector operations. If one of the surfaces is not planar but irregular, the intersection is a curved line which is more difficult to determine. One fundamental mapping problem geology students are early confronted with is the intersection of a planar feature (e.g. bedding or a fault) with the irregular land surface. This is elegantly summarized by the *Rule of V’s* ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig08>`)."

There are two exceptions: 1. If the contact is horizontal, its outcrop pattern will follow the topographic contours, which makes sense since the contours are the intersection of horizontal planes of different elevation with the ground ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig08>`a), and 2. If the contact is vertical, its outcrop pattern across the valley is a straight line. Vertical planes *ignore* topography.\n",

    "Determining the outcrop trace of a planar contact on irregular topography is not straightforward. Graphically, this problem involves making elevation contours on the planar contact. These are called structure contours. Then one should look at the location where the structure contours of the contact have the same elevation than the topographic contours of the land surface. On these locations, the contact outcrops. Finally, one should join these locations with a line, to make the outcrop trace of the contact. {numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig09>` illustrates this procedure for a plane dipping north and intersecting irregular topography. Notice how in the stream valleys, the outcrop trace of the plane curves to the north, clearly following the Rule of V’s."

    "A *stereonet* or stereographic projection is a special kind of azimuthal projection, where the point source or viewpoint lies on the surface of the sphere, and the projection plane passes through the center of the sphere. In a stereonet, the viewpoint is at the top of the sphere or zenith, the view direction is downwards, the projection plane is the equatorial plane dividing the sphere into lower and upper hemispheres, and the lower hemisphere (bowl in {numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig10>`a) is projected. In the stereonet, the rim of the bowl is called the primitive circle and it corresponds to a horizontal plane ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig10>`b). A net facilitates drawing any plane or line. This net consists of great circles representing N-S striking, 0-90E and W dipping planes, and small circles representing cones of N-S horizontal axis and 0-90apical radius opening to the N and S ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig10>`b). Several books explain the use of the stereonet to solve orientation problems (e.g. Marshak and Mitra, 1988).\n",

    "For our purpose, it is more important to know how this projection actually works. {numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig11>`a illustrates this on a vertical section passing through the center of the sphere.

    "where $x$ is the is the distance of the point from the center of the net, $R$ is the radius of the net, and $\\phi$ is the plunge of the line. This method preserves angles perfectly and thus, on the primitive circle, degrees are equally spaced, and a small circle will be a circle anywhere on the net ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig11>`b). This is why this projection is called the equal angle or Wulff stereonet. However, the preservation of angles has a disadvantage: areas are distorted. Thus, for example, a 10radius small circle will look smaller near the center of the net but larger near the edges ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig11>`b). This poses a problem when trying to visually evaluate the density of points plotted on the net."
