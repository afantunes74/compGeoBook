    "### Scales\n",
    "\n",
    "In cartography, we use scales to describe how the real world length has been reduced to fit on a page or screen. Usually, map scales are described as ratios, such as 1:50,000. When we describe the scale, we say it is either small or large. The description of small or large refers to the scale, not the size of the area. Therefore, if we describe a scale as small, it means the fraction described by the scale ratio is small; this in turn means the map covers a large area. The inverse is true for large scales; the fraction described by the scale is large and in turn covers a small area (Kraak and Ormeling, 2003, Lisle et al., 2011). There is not an official categorical differentiation between small and large scales. Generally speaking, small scale maps cover regions, countries, and continents, while large scale maps cover neighborhoods, towns, or counties. The following example illustrates this."

There are many resources for determining which projection you should use. Large-scale mapping uses conformal projection because angles measured on the ground are the same as those in the map (Iliffe and Lott, 2008). Four types of distortion are: area, shape, direction, and distance. The Tissot’s Indicatrix is a graphic device to show the distortion at a point (Robinson et al., 1995).

Consistent coordinate reference systems for data in a map is important because there may be spatial differences between the coordinate reference systems creating locational errors. A coordinate conversion is when the coordinate reference systems have the same datum. A coordinate transformation is when the coordinate reference systems have different datums.\n",

In Example 2, the Tissot’s Indicatrix ellipses did not change coordinate reference systems. The method used to plot the ellipses changed. In Example 3, we also only changed the projection of the map, not the coordinate reference system. In the following examples, we will make coordinate conversions and transformations.

    "It takes less than one second to run this code! Check the newly created csv file and notice that you now have a listing of coordinates in meters. The EPSG definition of the output coordinate reference system is listed under `dst_crs`. You can easily change this variable to another EPSG and rerun the script. If you wish to run the script on another file, change the `src_file` and `dst_file`, and the `src_dir` and `dst_dir` if the file is in another directory."

    "1. So far, you have worked with data sets that have been provided to you. It is an important skill to be able to find data sets online and to prepare them for use in your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program monitors, records, and maintains a global database of earthquake activity. The public can query the archive and download earthquake epicenter data. Go to the [Search Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/) page of the USGS. Using the Basic Options, download all of the magnitude 4.5+ earthquakes in the last year in the world. In the Output Options, choose a CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Modify the notebook [ch2-5](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/notebooks/ch2-5.ipynb) to transform the earthquake epicenters from latitude-longitude to World Mercator (or another map projection of your choice). Use this [pictographic](https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/70047422/report.pdf) for further information. The datum of the earthquake epicenters is likely WGS84.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Plot the earthquake epicenters. Make sure to include the outline of the continents.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    :::{hint}\n",
    "    Look at the notebook [ch2-2](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/notebooks/ch2-2.ipynb) for a starting point, and check the [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/#) website for examples of how to plot localities on a map.\n",
    "    :::\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Now modify your plot to color the earthquakes by depth (red are shallow and blue are deep earthquakes), and the size of the points by the earthquake magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Add the volcanoes from Example 6 ([volc_longlat.csv](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch2-5/volc_longlat.csv)) to the map (use triangles to indicate volcanoes). Do you see any correlation between the earthquake epicenters and the volcanoes?"
