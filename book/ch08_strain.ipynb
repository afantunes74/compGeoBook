    "Stresses acting through time within the Earth can lead to deformation. Deformation is more complicated than stress because it involves the comparison of states of the rock material at two different points in time. Therefore, one needs to establish both temporal and spatial reference frames. This chapter covers deformation and strain, including infinitesimal, finite, and progressive strain. This is a relatively long and complicated material, it comprises several chapters in classical books such as Ramsay (1967) and Means (1976). However, our purpose is not to discuss in detail the theory of strain, but rather introduce some interesting strain problems in geosciences, and their computation."

From the **P** and **T** axes, it is possible to calculate a moment tensor summation and the kinematic axes, which define two nodal planes separating the regions of extension (**T** axes) and shortening (**P** axes). The regions of extension are typically shaded, and so the diagram looks like a beach ball ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig04>`c). Beach ball diagrams are also used to display the focal mechanisms of earthquakes, where P-waves first arrivals pushing the ground up are marked as **T** axes, and those pushing the ground down are marked as **P** axes.

    "As an example, {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`a shows a deformed circle and an inscribed triangle after 30$^o$ clockwise shear. {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b shows the Mohr circle for this deformation. In the Mohr circle, the horizontal axis is $\\lambda'$, and the vertical axis is $\\gamma'$. We follow the convention of Ragan (2009): Positive angular shear, $\\psi$, corresponds to anticlockwise rotation of the original lineâ€™s normal ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`a), and the $\\gamma'$ axis in the Mohr circle increases downwards ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b). Notice that the angle between the horizontal axis and a line from the origin to any point in the Mohr circle is equal to $\\psi$. Therefore, a line from the origin and tangent to the Mohr circle indicates $\\psi_{\\text{max}}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b)."

These lines will intersect at a point called the *pole* to the Mohr circle ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b). From the pole, one can trace lines of any orientation; they will intersect the circle at points that represent the strain of lines with the same orientation in the physical plane. Thus, you can imagine the pole to be the center of the strain ellipse, and from it, it is easy to trace the principal axes of strain ($S_1$ and $S_3$), the lines of no finite elongation (LNFE, $\\lambda'=1$), and the lines of maximum shear strain ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b)."

    "\n",
    "If we have a group of points or stations with displacement data, we can determine the finite strain following a strategy similar to the one we used for infinitesimal strain. The function [grid_fin_strain](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/grid_fin_strain.py) computes and plots the finite strain for a group of points with displacement data. This function is very similar to our previous function `grid_strain`, and therefore we only include its header here. Notice that after computing the displacement gradient in the undeformed (`frame` = 0) or deformed (`frame` = 1) configuration, we use our function `fin_strain` to compute the finite strain in each cell."

    "1. This exercise is from Rowland and Duebendorfer (1994). The file [bar.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch8-exercise1/bar.txt) contains the strike and dip (RHR), slip direction, and slip sense of faults within the Basin and Range province, specifically southern Nevada and the Lake Mead area. Plot the **P** and **T** axes for these data using the function `pt_axes`. Are these data consistent with the regional E-W extension direction in the Basin and Range province?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the **P** and **T** axes, one can compute an unweighted moment tensor summation as follows (Allmendinger et al., 1989):\n",

    "    $$\n",
    "    \\scriptstyle \\mathbf{K} = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\scriptstyle\\sum (P_N)^{2} - (T_N)^{2}  & \\scriptstyle\\sum (P_N) (P_E) - (T_N) (T_E) & \\scriptstyle\\sum (P_N) (P_D) - (T_N) (T_D) \\\\ \\scriptstyle\\sum (P_E) (P_N) - (T_E) (T_N) & \\scriptstyle\\sum (P_E)^{2} - (T_E)^{2} & \\scriptstyle\\sum (P_E) (P_D) - (T_E) (T_D) \\\\ \\scriptstyle\\sum (P_D) (P_N) - (T_D) (T_N) & \\scriptstyle\\sum (P_D) (P_E) - (T_D) (T_E) & \\scriptstyle\\sum (P_D)^{2} - (T_D)^{2}\\end{array}\\right]\n",

    "    where the subscripts $N$, $E$, and $D$ refer to the east, north and  down direction cosines of the **P** and **T** axes. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{K}$ give the relative magnitudes and orientations of the kinematic axes. These kinematic axes define the orientation of two nodal planes, or possible faults, separating the areas of infinitesimal extension (**T** axes) from those of infinitesimal shortening (**P** axes). The faults intersect at the intermediate eigenvector, the minimum and maximum eigenvectors define the movement plane, and the faults slip vectors are on the movement plane at 45 from the minimum and maximum eigenvectors. Modify the function `pt_axes` to plot the nodal planes. This is not a simple problem, donâ€™t give up.\n",

    "3. The file [andes.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch8-exercise2/andes.txt) contains GPS data (stations UTM coordinates and displacements in meters) from the Central Andes (Kendrick et al., 2001; Brooks et al., 2003). Compute the infinitesimal rotation in this region using the function `grid_strain`. What does the rotation tell you about the tectonics of this region? Check Allmendinger et al. (2005) to support your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The file [antithetic.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch8-exercise3/antithetic.txt) contains data from a discrete element model of a low angle normal fault (deformed elementsâ€™ coordinates and displacements). Use the function `grid_fin_strain` to compute the shear strain of this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The file [trilobite.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch8-exercise4/trilobite.txt) contains the undeformed $x$ and $y$ coordinates of points delineating a trilobite specimen. Deform the trilobite using **a.** pure shear with $S_1 = 2.0$, **b.** simple shear with $\\gamma = 1.0$, and **c.** general shear with $S_1 = 1.5$, $\\gamma = 1.0$, and shear direction and $S_1$ parallel to $x$.\n",
