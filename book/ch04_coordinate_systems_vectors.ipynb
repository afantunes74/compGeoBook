    "Strike and dip, and trend and plunge, are a convenient way to represent the orientation of planes and lines. However, it is difficult to handle these measurements using computation. In this chapter, we will see how to convert linear features (lines and poles to planes) from spherical (trend and plunge) to Cartesian (direction cosines) coordinates, thus representing these features as vectors. This facilitates the analysis of planes and lines using linear algebra and computation, and it will allow us to solve a range of interesting problems using vector operations."

We will call the axes of this coordinate system $\\mathbf{X_1}$, $\\mathbf{X_2}$ and $\\mathbf{X_3}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig01>`). In addition, we will follow a right-handed naming convention: If you hold your right hand so that your thumb points in the positive direction of the first axis $\\mathbf{X_1}$, your other fingers should curl from the positive direction of the second axis $\\mathbf{X_2}$ toward the positive direction of the third axis $\\mathbf{X_3}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig01>`). Such a coordinate system is called a right-handed coordinate system.\n",

The **ENU** coordinate system is used in GIS and Geophysics when dealing with elevations (e.g. topography), while the **NED** coordinate system is used in Structural Geology where, by convention, angles measured downwards from the horizontal (e.g. plunge of a downward pointing line) are considered positive. In this chapter, we will use mainly the **NED** coordinate system, but when dealing with topography and elevations, we will use the **ENU** coordinate system."

These lines can be for example poles to bedding, paleocurrent directions, paleomagnetic poles, or slip vectors on a fault surface. This problem can be solved using vector addition. The resultant vector $\\mathbf{r}$ of the sum of the $N$ unit vectors representing the lines has components:\n",

It also calculates the Fisher statistics for the mean vector (Fisher et al., 1987), which is the standard way to represent uncertainties in this analysis. Notice that `calc_mv` uses our two previous functions `sph_to_cart` and `cart_to_sph` to convert from spherical to Cartesian coordinates, and vice versa."

Determine: (a) the trend and plunge of the hinge line of the fold, (b) the rake of the hinge line in limb A, (c) the rake of the hinge line in limb B."

    "The three points problem is a fundamental problem in geology. It is based on the fact that three non-collinear points on a plane define the orientation of the plane. The graphical solution to this problem is introduced early in Geosciences. It involves finding the strike line (a line connecting two points of equal elevation) on the plane, and the dip from two strike lines (two structure contours) on the plane.\n",
    "\n",

The function [three_points](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/three_points.py) computes the strike and dip of a plane from the east (**E**), north (**N**), and up (**U**) coordinates of three points on the plane:"
