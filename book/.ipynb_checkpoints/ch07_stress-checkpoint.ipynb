    "The solution to this problem consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transform the stress tensor to principal stress coordinates. Here we can use the function `principal_stress`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Transform the pole to the plane $\\mathbf{p}$ to principal stress coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compute the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch07_fig07>`) in principal stress coordinates using Cauchy’s law (Eq. {eq}`ch07_eq04`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. $\\mathbf{p}$, $\\mathbf{t}$ and the maximum shear traction $\\mathbf{s}$ fall along the same plane ({numref}`Figure %s <ch07_fig07>`). This plane is known as the *movement plane* (Marshak and Mitra, 1988). The pole to the movement plane is the line of zero shear traction $\\mathbf{b}$. Therefore, we can calculate $\\mathbf{b}$ by the cross product of $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{p}$, and $\\mathbf{s}$ by the cross product of $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a transformation matrix $\\mathbf{a}$ between the principal stress coordinates and the fault plane coordinates. This matrix has as the first row $\\mathbf{p}$, the second row $\\mathbf{b}$, and the third row $\\mathbf{s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Transform the stress tensor from principal stress coordinates to fault plane coordinates. For the transformed tensor, $\\mathbf{X'_1}$  is the pole to the plane $\\mathbf{p}$, and $\\mathbf{X'_3}$ is the direction of the maximum shear traction $\\mathbf{s}$. Therefore, $\\sigma'_{11}$ is the normal traction on the plane, and $\\sigma'_{13}$ is the maximum shear traction on the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Transform $\\mathbf{p}$, $\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{s}$ from principal stress coordinates to $\\mathbf{NED}$ coordinates and find their orientations (trend and plunge).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function [shear_on_plane](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/shear_on_plane.py) follows these steps and computes the normal and maximum shear tractions on a plane of any orientation, and under a stress tensor of any orientation:"

    "N-S planes parallel to $\\sigma_2$ plot on the $\\sigma_1$-$\\sigma_3$ circle. Planes dipping east show positive, anticlockwise shear, while planes dipping west show negative, clockwise shear. Another way to visualize this is using the pole to planes, $O_P$. With $\\sigma_1$ horizontal and $\\sigma_3$ vertical, $O_P$ is at $\\sigma_1$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch07_fig05>`). From $O_P$ you can trace N-S planes of any dip to the E or W, and verify that E dipping planes have anticlockwise shear, while W dipping planes have clockwise shear. Planes non-parallel to $\\sigma_2$ are more difficult to visualize. On the NE planes dipping to the SE the shear tractions are clockwise, while on the SE planes dipping to the SW the shear tractions are anticlockwise. These planes plot inside the $\\sigma_1$-$\\sigma_3$ circle but outside the $\\sigma_2$-$\\sigma_3$ and $\\sigma_1$-$\\sigma_2$ circles (in fact no plane will plot inside these internal circles)."

(2012): In the Oseberg field, North Sea, the principal stresses are oriented $\\sigma_1$ = 080/00, $\\sigma_2$ = 000/90, and $\\sigma_3$ = 170/00. If at 2 km depth, $\\sigma_1$ = 50 MPa, $\\sigma_2$ = 40 MPa, and $\\sigma_3$ = 30 MPa, what are the normal and shear tractions on a plane oriented 040/65 (RHR)?\n",

    "2. Morris and Ferrill (2009) discuss the importance of the intermediate principal stress, $\\sigma_2$, for faulting. Let’s look at their first example: The maximum and minimum principal stresses are 95 MPa and 25 MPa, respectively. $\\sigma_1$ is vertical and $\\sigma_3$ is horizontal and trends E-W. Compute the normal and maximum shear tractions acting on three planes with orientation (RHR) 180/45, 090/45 and 135/45, and for principal stress ratios, $R$, between 0 and 1. Display your results graphically in a lower hemisphere equal area stereonet showing the maximum shear directions on the planes, and a graph of $R$ versus the normal and maximum shear tractions. How do these tractions vary with $R$ on the N-S and E-W planes? How do they vary on the SE-NW plane?\n",

    ":::\n",

    "3. The slip tendency is the ratio of the maximum shear traction to the normal traction on a plane ($S_t=\\tau/\\sigma$). It is a proxy for the tendency of a surface to undergo slip under a given stress field (Morris et al., 1996). Write a Python function that for a given stress tensor and stress coordinate system, plots a lower hemisphere equal area stereonet and a Mohr circle colored by slip tendency. The function should work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `slip_tendency(stress,tx1,px1,tx3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "    where `stress` is the stress tensor, `tx1` and `px1` are the trend and plunge of $\\mathbf{X_1}$, and `tx3` is the trend of $\\mathbf{X_3}$. Use the function to graph the slip tendency for the stress tensor in the notebook [ch7-3](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/notebooks/ch7-3.ipynb). {numref}`Figure %s <ch07_fig08>` shows how the output of the function should look like. Based on your results, at which dip angle would you expect the N-S to slip? Will planes with the maximum possible shear traction ($\\sigma_1-\\sigma_3$) slip?\n",

Plot each pole colored by slip tendency on a stereonet and a Mohr circle. Use a color scale bar similar to {numref}`Figure %s <ch07_fig08>`. Since you will be handling about 30,000 planes and since the direction and sense of the maximum shear traction in this case are not relevant, you can consider calculating the normal and maximum shear tractions using Eq. {eq}`ch07_eq06`.\n",
