    "Many problems in geology, like in real life, are simpler when viewed from another perspective. For example, when studying the movement of continents through time because of plate tectonics ({numref}`Figure %s <ch05_fig01>`a), two coordinate systems are required, one in a present-day geographic frame, and another one attached to the continent. Or to analyze a fault ({numref}`Figure %s <ch05_fig01>`b), we need one coordinate system attached to the fault (with one axis parallel to the pole and another to the slickensides), which we may want to relate to the more familiar **NED** system. A change in coordinate system is called a coordinate transformation and this is an operation that happens everywhere. Computer games, flight simulators, and subsurface interpretation programs rely heavily on coordinate transformations."

In a cylindrical fold, the fold axis is a line of minimum, zero curvature, and the lines of maximum, non-zero curvature are perpendicular to it (Suppe, 1985). The least distorted view of such structure is on the plane perpendicular to the fold axis, which is called the profile plane ({numref}`Figure %s <ch05_fig06>`). Projecting the fold data to this profile plane is called a *down-plunge* projection.\n",

    "### Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotations are essential in geology. For example, if from a current lineation on a tilted bed we want to estimate the direction of the current that deposited the bed, we need to rotate the bed (and the lineation) back to their pre-tilting orientation. The stereonet is a convenient device to rotate lines and planes around a horizontal axis or a vertical axis, but it is rather difficult to make rotations around an axis of a different orientation (Marshak and Mitra, 1988).\n",
    "\n",
    "A rotation is also a coordinate transformation from an old coordinate system $\\mathbf{X_1}\\mathbf{X_2}\\mathbf{X_3}$ to a new coordinate system $\\mathbf{X_1\\text{'}}\\mathbf{X_2\\text{'}}\\mathbf{X_3\\text{'}}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch05_fig08>`). The rotation axis is specified by its trend and plunge, and the magnitude of rotation is given by the angle $\\omega$ which is positive for clockwise rotation and vice versa ({numref}`Figure %s <ch05_fig08>`). The difficult part is that the rotation axis may not coincide with the axes of either the old or the new coordinate system (unlike the down-plunge projection).\n",
    "\n",
    "The components of the transformation matrix **a** defining the rotation, which are the direction cosines of the new coordinate system $\\mathbf{X_1\\text{'}}\\mathbf{X_2\\text{'}}\\mathbf{X_3\\text{'}}$ with respect to the old coordinate system $\\mathbf{X_1}\\mathbf{X_2}\\mathbf{X_3}$, can be found using spherical trigonometry (Allmendinger et al., 2012) or linear algebra as we did before. Here, we give them without proof. If $\\cos\\alpha$, $\\cos\\beta$ and $\\cos\\gamma$ are the direction cosines of the rotation axis in the **NED** coordinate system ({numref}`ch04_tab01`), and $\\omega$ is the amount of rotation, the elements of matrix **a** are:\n",

    "### Plotting great and small circles using rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation matrix **a** that describes the rotation (Eq. {eq}`ch05_eq21`), provides a simple and elegant way to draw great and small circles on a stereonet. As you may suspect from the previous notebook, to draw a great circle, we just need to rotate the strike line of the plane around the pole to the plane in fixed increments (e.g. 1) until completing 180. This is the same as drawing lines on the plane of incrementally larger rake from 0 to 180. To draw a small circle, we just need to rotate a line around the axis of the conic section in fixed increments (e.g. 1) until completing 360. Any line making an angle less than 90with the axis of rotation will trace a cone, which will plot on the stereonet as a small circle. The functions [great_circle](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/great_circle.py) and [small_circle](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/small_circle.py) return the path of a great or small circle on an equal angle or equal area stereonet:"

    "Normally, stereonets are displayed looking straight down, with the primitive equal to the horizontal. However, sometimes it is convenient to look at the stereonet in another orientation. For example, one may want to plot data in the plane of a cross section with the view direction perpendicular to the section, or in a down-plunge projection with the view direction parallel to the fold axis. The function [geogr_to_view](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/geogr_to_view.py) enables to plot great and small circles on a stereonet of any view direction, by transforming the poles of rotation from **NED** coordinates to the view direction coordinates:"

    "    This exercise is normally solved graphically ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig09>`. Here, we’ll use computation. The files [XGE.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch5-exercise3/XGE.txt), [YGE.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch5-exercise3/YGE.txt), and [ZGE.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch5-exercise3/ZGE.txt) are the **ENU** coordinates of the points of the DEM grid (these arrays follow the format of the NumPy `meshgrid` function). Points A, B, C and D have the following **ENU** coordinates:\n",

    "    Use the function `outcrop_trace` to compute the contacts. Follow a procedure similar to notebook [ch5-3](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/notebooks/ch5-3.ipynb). In this case though, some contacts will intersect. At contacts intersections you will need to determine which contact cuts the other: e.g. the Jurassic dyke will cut the Triassic sequence, but it will be covered by the Cretaceous and Tertiary sequences.\n",

    "4. This exercise is from Marshak and Mitra (1988). It is hard to solve using a stereonet. Here, you will use the function `rotate` to solve it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In eastern New York, there is an important unconformity called the Taconic unconformity. It separates Mid-Ordovician flysch from Devonian limestone. At a locality near the town of Catskill, the limestone (and the unconformity) is oriented 195/44 (RHR). An anticline occurs in the underlying flysch. One limb is presently oriented 240/73 (limb 1), and the other limb is presently oriented 020/41 (limb 2) (RHR). Flute casts occur in the Ordovician strata on limb 1 (NW dipping limb) and they have an orientation of 037/52.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. What was the orientation of each of the two fold limbs before tilting of the unconformity?\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t\t:::{hint}\n",
    "\t\tRotate the pole of the unconformity about the strike line of the unconformity to make it vertical. Apply the same rotation to the poles of the limbs and the flute casts. Find the orientation of the limbs from their rotated poles.\n",
    "\t\t:::\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. What was the orientation of the fold axis prior to tilting?\n",
    "    \n",
    "\t\t:::{hint}\n",
    "\t\tThe fold axis is the intersection of the limbs before tilting of the unconformity. Use the module `angles` to solve this.\n",
    "\t\t:::\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. What was the trend of the current direction responsible for the formation of the flute casts in Ordovician time? *Hint*: Rotate the fold axis computed in (b) about a horizontal line perpendicular to it, to bring it to the horizontal. Apply the same rotation to the poles of the limbs and the flute casts. Then, rotate the poles of the limbs about the horizontal fold axis to make them vertical. Apply the same rotation to the flute casts. If the rotations are correct, the flute casts should be horizontal and their trend is the orientation of the current in the Ordovician.\n",
    "    4. What is the present orientation of the flute casts on limb 2 (SE dipping limb)?\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t\t:::{hint}\n",
    "\t\tThe trend of the flute casts on limb 2 in the Ordovician is the trend you got in (c) minus 180. The plunge of the flute casts is of course zero. Apply to the flute casts on limb 2, the inverse of the rotations you applied to the pole of limb 2 to bring them back to their present orientation.\n",

    "    5. Plot the results of (a), (b), (c) and (d) as poles and lines on a stereonet. Use colors to indicate the different stages of rotation, and markers to indicate the different elements: unconformity, limbs, fold axis, and flute casts."
