    "## Solving problems by computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Geology is an interpretive and historical science (Frodeman, 1995). We observe, collect, analyze, and interpret data (what) to tell a story (why). To collect data, we need to take measurements. All measurements have some uncertainty, and therefore uncertainty and error propagation are important in geosciences, and they are a recurring topic in this resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last 50 years or more, the methods geoscientists have used to visualize, analyze and interpret data are mostly graphical. For example, in structural geology, students typically learn two types of graphical constructions: orthographic and spherical projections (stereonets) (Ragan, 2009). Although these methods are great to visualize and solve geometrical problems in three-dimensions, they are not amenable to computation, and therefore applying these methods to large datasets with thousands of entries is impractical. Plane and spherical trigonometry allow deriving formulas (e.g. apparent dip formula) for computation (Ragan, 2009). However, these formulas give little insight about the problems. They are just formulas associated with complex geometric constructions, which bear no relation to each other, and which are difficult to combine to solve more complicated problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that many of the most interesting problems in geosciences can be solved using linear algebra, and vectors and tensors (Allmendinger et al., 2012). Linear algebra also happens to be the language of computation. The main purpose of this resource is to show how to solve problems in geosciences using computation. There are several advantages of following this approach. It will enhance your mathematical and computational skills, as well as promote your geological-mathematical problem solving disposition. In today’s digital age, these skills are very useful."

    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of programming language is important. While computer languages such as C or C++ are ideal to work with large datasets and computer-intensive operations, they involve a steep learning curve associated with their syntax, compilation, and execution (Jacobs et al., 2016). These coding details have little to do with the problem-solving approach of this resource. Interpretive languages such as Python, R or Matlab are a better choice because of their simpler syntax, and the interpretation and execution of commands as they are called (no need for compilation). In addition, these languages have access to an integrated development environment (IDE) that facilitates writing and debugging programs, and to many standard libraries that perform advanced tasks such as matrix operations and data visualization. Thus, Python, R or Matlab are “scientific packages” rather than just programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this resource, the language of choice is Python. Besides the reasons above, Python has the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python can be learned quickly. It typically involves less code than other languages and its syntax is easier to read.\n",
    "-   Python comes with robust standard libraries for arrays and mathematical functions (NumPy), visualization (Pyplot), and scientific computing (SciPy).\n",
    "-   As of December 2022, Python is the most popular programming language followed by C, C++, and Java ([TIOBE index](https://tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)), with a large base of developers and users. It is used by every major technology company and it is almost a skill you must have in your CV to land a job as a geoscientist.\n",
    "-   Because of its large developers base, Python has access to a large amount of external libraries, including several libraries for geosciences. We make use of some of these libraries in this resource.\n",
    "-   Python can be installed easily through a single distribution that includes all the standard libraries and provides access to external libraries (see next section).\n",
    "-   Last but not least, Python is free and open source. This is probably why Python is more popular than its commercial counterparts."

This distribution includes Python as well as many other useful applications, including Jupyter, which is the system we use to write the notebooks in this resource. Anaconda can be easily installed on any major operating system, including Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n",

Windows and macOS users just need to download the Graphical installer, run it, and follow the steps to install Anaconda. Linux users need to download the installer and type a set of commands in a terminal window.
